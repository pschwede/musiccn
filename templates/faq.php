		<h3>I don't like the music!</h3>
		Skip that song! It's likely that there are better ones. Actually, skipping is a very important tool at Musiccn. It helps Musiccn to know if the track matches your mood.

		<h3>Please, what do the moods mean?!</h3>
		Well basically they're sorted like that:
		<ul>
			<li>Top -> Bottom = Fast music &rarr; Slow music</li>
			<li>Left -> Right = sad/aggressive music &rarr; happy music</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="stripe text">
		<h3>The song doesn't fit my mood!</h3>
		Be a little tolerant - and skip that song! Musiccn plays random songs if none are forced by the djs or there's none playable that fits better right now. (Tracks aren't repeated during a certain time.)
	</div>
	<div class="stripe text">
		<h3>What if I like the song but it isn't in the mood/genre I have chosen?</h3>
		Don't worry. Just play it if you like to hear it now. If not, just skip it. Keep it natural. Musiccn can handle that. (But try to keep the mood adjusted.)
